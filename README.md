## My process

Alongside the challenge, I used Figma for the design details and VS Code to work through the html and css. Then used Github and Netlify to finish up.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

How to start looking at a brief such as these in the challenges and applying what I have learnt so far in my coding experience with what could be an actual project.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning how to read these sorts of projects and practice using the tools to bring them to completion so that I feel more comfortable with it all.
